# Film-Streaming-Website

Movie Streaming website inspired by multiple website UI/UX designs. I have combined those to build this website. It has 7 pages with their own contents. I used FlexBox and Grids extensively in the website. It is fully responsive. I have used functional components and hooks as well as Context API to be able to avid prop-drilling and let my components have access to the global data. 

I utilized in this project:

 	* ReactJS
  
 	* Javascript
  
 	* SASS
  
 	* Material-Ui
  
 	* Framer Motion
  
 	* React-Hook-Form
  
 	* React-Youtube
  
 	* React-Router-Dom
